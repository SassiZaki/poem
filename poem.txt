To laugh often and love much;
To win the respect of intelligent persons
And the affection of children;
To earn the approbation of honest critics
And to endure the betrayal of false friends;
To appreciate beauty;
To find the best in others;
To give of one's self;
To leave the world a little better,
Whether by a healthy kid,
A garden patch
Or a redeemed social condition;
hey this is my first ever branch ! woooo hoo
hopefully this works
